# sequelizeburger
U of M Bootcamp Assignment 15: Sequelize

This is a simple app to demonstrate full-stack development with an emphasis on sequelize library usage.  Usage is simple -- the user simply adds burgers to a list that he or she would like to eat, and then clicks the DEVOUR IT button next to the burger to nosh on it.  It will then appear in the list to the right.
